This is an open source project. This project can be customized with new tasks to perform different operations to suit your organization's needs.

## Build Scripts ##

Use 'npm run' and one of the following shortcuts if desired. Ex: 'npm run build'

    clean
    - Clears the output folder of all build files

    build
    - Executes the clean command and builds the project using tsc --build

    createExtension
    - Outputs a .vsix file to your project. This is the extension to upload to Azure DevOps (or TFS).

## Installation requirements ##

Because this extension works with the Kiuwan Application Security platform, you need a Kiuwan account in our cloud service or an on-premise installation of the Kiuwan platform to use it.
